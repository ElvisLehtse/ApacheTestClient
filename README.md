This project is designed to connect to the localhost server runned by SunTestServer project.

It runs the client side where the user can input commands and data in the terminal to read from and write to a json file.
Currently, the unit tests and shellscript file is missing.
To run the project, first run SunTestServer and then run the ApacheTestClient to connect to the server.
If using IntelliJ then the IDE should automatically build the Maven project and you should be able to run it.
